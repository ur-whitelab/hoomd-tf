-----------------------

*New Features*

- Made code consistent for hoomd-blue plugin.
- Added config options and tested XLA benchmarks for CG mapping operators code and other multistep complex code.
- It is now possible to compile the plugin after hoomd-blue install

*Enhancements*

- Changed output logging to only output TF items to the tf_manager.log and
- The log-level is consistent with that in hoomd.
- Add C++ tests and coverage analysis.
- Swtiched to using hoomd-blue cuda error codes.
- Added MPI tests with domain decomposition.

*Bug Fixes*

- Cmake now checks for TF and hoomd versions while building hoomd-tf.
- Batch positions/nlist for execution because very large systems cannot fit a complex NN model into memory.
