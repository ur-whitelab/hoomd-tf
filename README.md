# Hoomd-TF

This plugin enables the use of TensorFlow in a [Hoomd-blue](http://glotzerlab.engin.umich.edu/hoomd-blue/) simulation to compute quantities like forces and collective variables and do learning while running a simulation. You may also use it without hoomd-blue to process trajectories via [MDAnalysis](https://www.mdanalysis.org/). Please see [here for documentation](https://ur-whitelab.github.io/hoomd-tf/) for install and usage instructions.

# Tutorials
