# CMake script for finding HOOMD and setting up all needed compile options to create and link a plugin library
#
# Variables taken as input to this module:
# HOOMD_ROOT :          location to look for HOOMD, if it is not in the python path
#
# Variables defined by this module:
# FOUND_HOOMD :         set to true if HOOMD is found
# HOOMD_LIBRARIES :     a list of all libraries needed to link to to access hoomd (uncached)
# HOOMD_INCLUDE_DIR :   a list of all include directories that need to be set to include HOOMD
# HOOMD_LIB :           a cached var locating the hoomd library to link to
#
# various ENABLE_ flags translated from hoomd_config.h so this plugin build can match the ABI of the installed hoomd
#
# as a convenience (for the intended purpose of this find script), all include directories and definitions needed
# to compile with all the various libs (boost, python, winsoc, etc...) are set within this script
